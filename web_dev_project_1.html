          <h2>The Business Titan of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Ratan Tata</b> is an Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Group, one of India’s largest and oldest conglomerates. Born on December 28, 1937, he studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University and later completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School. He joined the Tata Group in 1962 and eventually took over as chairman in 1991. During his tenure, he led the company through significant expansions, including the global acquisitions of Tetley, Corus, and Jaguar-Land Rover, which transformed Tata from a largely India-focused group into an international brand. He also oversaw the launch of the Tata Nano, which aimed to provide affordable transportation for middle-class families in India. Even after his retirement in 2012, and a brief return as interim chairman in 2016, Ratan Tata has remained active in business and philanthropy through the Tata Trusts, which control a majority stake in Tata Sons and fund various social causes. He is known for his reserved personality and a strong belief in ethical business practices.
